# üß† MICCAI Computational Precision Medicine (CPM) Grand Challenge  
## Predicting Local Tumor Control in Oropharyngeal Cancer Using Radiomics and Clinical Data

---

## üìñ Description

Cancers arising from the head and neck have become increasingly more studied in the past few years, especially cancers of the oropharynx which are now epidemic domestically, with over 20,000 annual cases projected in the U.S. Growing evidence has established differential clinical, pathological, molecular, and epidemiological attributes between human papilloma virus-associated (HPV+) and HPV-negative (HPV-) oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) disease entities.

Recent data suggest that **radiomics**, or extraction of image texture analysis to generate mineable quantitative data from medical images, can reflect phenotypes for various cancers. Several groups have shown that developed radiomics signatures, in head and neck cancers among other tumor sites, can be correlated with survival outcomes. Radiomics features from metabolic imaging modalities, like **18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (18F-FDG PET)** have been postulated as surrogates for underlying tumor biology, and hence prognosis.

This competition is organized as a **Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) Computational Precision Medicine (CPM)** grand challenge. Contestants are tasked to predict, using primary tumor 18F-FDG PET-derived radiomics features ¬± matched clinical data, whether a tumor arising from the oropharynx will be controlled by definitive radiation treatment (RT).

The **University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC)** head and neck radiation oncology team curated and harmonized a multi-institutional dataset of **248 oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) patients**, using the in-house *LAMBDA-RAD* data management platform.  
Scans were collected from six institutes:

- **US**: MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC)  
- **Canada**: Four Qu√©bec institutions ‚Äî H√¥pital G√©n√©ral Juif de Montr√©al (HGJ), Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS), Centre Hospitalier de l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Montr√©al (CHUM), and H√¥pital Maisonneuve-Rosemont (HMR)  
- **Europe**: MAASTRO Clinic, The Netherlands

## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenge Workflow

This dataset encompasses anonymized **18F-FDG-PET DICOM-RT files**, and expert-segmented contours of primary tumors propagated from computed tomography (CT) to PET scans (*DICOM-RTSTRUCT*).  
It also includes relevant clinical data, known etiological/biological correlates, and **tumor control outcomes** as ground truth.

The main goal is to assess the ability of participant-developed radiomics workflows to predict binary outcomes (local tumor recurrence) using a defined **training cohort** that includes all input and outcome data.

Participants should anticipate real-life clinical challenges, including:
- Tumor segmentation and image co-registration
- Inter-scanner variability

## üìÖ Timeline and Submissions

All participants in the MICCAI challenge are required to provide:
- A **1-page abstract** or **up to 4-page computational algorithm report**
- Submission deadline: **August 30, 2018**
- Upload link: [Dropbox submission portal](https://www.dropbox.com/request/rsIk3dGq5a9G8V3FBv2u)

Accepted abstracts will be published in the **Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)** collection.  
Updates can be made until **November 1**, after the conference.  
Top 3 team members will be included as co-authors in the final report manuscript.

## üßÆ Evaluation

Participants will be ranked according to the **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)** calculated on the private subset of the test set.

### Dataset Split
- **Training set:** Half of the 18F-FDG PET files (DICOM-RT format)
- **Test set:** Remaining half, with a **public subset** for leaderboard ranking

### Scoring Process
1. Public leaderboard: performance on public test subset  
2. Private leaderboard: final ranking based on hold-out subset  

Each team may submit **two final models** for evaluation.

## ü©ª DICOM Resources

**DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)** is the standard format for managing medical images and related metadata.  
Several open-source texture analysis tools can be used to extract radiomics features:

- [**IBEX (Imaging Biomarker Explorer)**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ibex-mda/?source=directory) ‚Äî MATLAB / C++
- [**Pyradiomics**](http://www.radiomics.io/pyradiomics.html) ‚Äî Python package for radiomics feature extraction  
- [**MazDa**](http://www.eletel.p.lodz.pl/programy/mazda/index.php?action=mazda) ‚Äî C++ / Delphi¬© texture parameter calculator  
- [**CGITA**](http://code.google.com/p/cgita) ‚Äî MATLAB-based texture analysis toolbox  

If you know of additional open-access software, please contact: [hmelhalawani@mdanderson.org](mailto:hmelhalawani@mdanderson.org)
